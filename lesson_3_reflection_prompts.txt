When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When local storage is not enough for building a big project or I want to replace my old computer and buy a new personal computer; 
  When I need to use another computer to access my project and work on it; 
  When I want to share my project with other friends.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If multiple branches are working together, I need to pull manually to check what new changes are from other people. And I need to take controll of what new stuff is in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks: between repositories on GitHub. to copy a whole repository from one user's account to another user's account
	clones: between remote repository or local repository and local. copy a repository either from remote site or your local directory to your own local working directory
	branches: copy a commit and make it a branch to get separated. when you want to do something in parallel

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	People can find out what local change he has made from the last clone.
